C-SKY Multi-processors Interrupt Controller
===========================================

C-SKY Multi-processors Interrupt Controller is designed for ck807/ck810/ck860
SMP soc, and it also could be used in non-SMP system.

Interrupt number definition:

  0-15  : software irq, and we use 15 as our IPI_IRQ.
 16-31  : private  irq, and we use 16 as the co-processor timer.
 31-1024: common irq for soc ip.
