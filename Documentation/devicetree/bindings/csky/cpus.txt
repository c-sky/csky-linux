==================
C-SKY CPU Bindings
==================

The device tree allows to describe the layout of CPUs in a system through
the "cpus" node, which in turn contains a number of subnodes (ie "cpu")
defining properties for every cpu.

Only SMP system need to care about the cpus node and single processor
needn't define cpus node at all.

=====================================
cpus and cpu node bindings definition
=====================================

- cpus node

        Description: Container of cpu nodes

        The node name must be "cpus".

        A cpus node must define the following properties:

        - #address-cells
                Usage: required
                Value type: <u32>
                Definition: must be set to 1
        - #size-cells
                Usage: required
                Value type: <u32>
                Definition: must be set to 0

- cpu node

        Description: Describes one of SMP cores

        PROPERTIES

        - device_type
                Usage: required
                Value type: <string>
                Definition: must be "cpu"
        - reg
                Usage: required
                Value type: <u32>
                Definition: CPU index
        - status:
                Usage: required
                Value type: <string>
                Definition: "ok"       means enable  the cpu-core
                            "disabled" means disable the cpu-core

Example:
--------

	cpus {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		cpu@0 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			reg = <0>;
			status = "ok";
		};

		cpu@1 {
			device_type = "cpu";
			reg = <1>;
			status = "ok";
		};
	};
